This package contains DirectXTex, a shared source library for reading and writing \fC\&.DDS\fP files, and performing various texture content processing operations including resizing, format conversion, mip-map generation, block compression for Direct3D runtime texture resources, and height-map to normal-map conversion\&. This library makes use of the Windows Image \fBComponent\fP (WIC) APIs\&. It also includes \fC\&.TGA\fP and \fC\&.HDR\fP readers and writers since these image file formats are commonly used for texture content processing pipelines, but are not currently supported by a built-in WIC codec\&.
.PP
This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2019 (16\&.9 or later), Visual Studio 2022, or clang for Windows v11 or later\&. Use of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update SDK (\fC19041\fP) or later is required\&.
.PP
These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the legacy DirectX SDK\&. For details, see \fCWhere is the DirectX SDK?\fP\&.

\fCDirectXTex\\\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
This contains the DirectXTex library\&. This includes a full-featured DDS reader and writer including legacy format conversions, a TGA reader and writer, a HDR reader and writer, a WIC-based bitmap reader and writer (BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and HD Photo), and various texture processing functions\&. This is intended primarily for tool usage\&.

Only \fC\fBDirectXTex\&.h\fP\fP and \fCDirectXTex\&.inl\fP are meant as the 'public' header for the library\&.

\fCTexconv\\\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
This DirectXTex sample is an implementation of the \fCtexconv\fP command-line texture utility from the DirectX SDK utilizing DirectXTex rather than D3DX\&.
.PP
It supports the same arguments as the \fI\fBTexture\fP Conversion Tool Extended\fP (\fCtexconvex\&.exe\fP) legacy DirectX SDK utility\&. The primary differences are the \fC-10\fP and \fC-11\fP arguments are not applicable and the filter names (\fCPOINT\fP, \fCLINEAR\fP, \fCCUBIC\fP, \fCFANT\fP or \fCBOX\fP, \fCTRIANGLE\fP, \fC*_DITHER\fP, \fC*_DITHER_DIFFUSION\fP)\&. This also includes support for the JPEG XR (HD Photo) bitmap format\&.

This DirectXTex sample is a \fCcommand-line utility\fP for creating cubemaps, volume maps, or texture arrays from a set of individual input image files\&.

\fCDDSView\\\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
This DirectXTex sample is a simple Direct3D 11-based viewer for DDS files\&. For array textures or volume maps, the '<' and '>' keyboard keys will show different images contained in the DDS\&. The '1' through '0' keys can also be used to jump to a specific image index\&.

\fCDDSTextureLoader\\\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
This contains a streamlined version of the legacy DirectX SDK sample \fIDDSWithoutD3DX11\fP texture loading code for a simple light-weight runtime DDS loader\&. There are versions for Direct3D 9, Direct3D 11, and Direct3D 12\&. This performs no runtime pixel data conversions\&. This is ideal for runtime usage, and supports the full complement of Direct3D texture resources (1D, 2D, volume maps, cubemaps, mipmap levels, texture arrays, BC formats, etc\&.)\&.
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCScreenGrab\\\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
This contains texture writing modules for Direct3D 9, Direct3D 11, and Direct3D 12 primarily intended for creating screenshots\&. The images are written as a DDS or as an image file format using WIC\&.
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCWICTextureLoader\\\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
This contains a Direct3D 9, Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 2D texture loader that uses WIC to load a bitmap (BMP, JPEG, PNG, HD Photo, or other WIC supported file container), resize if needed based on the current feature level (or by explicit parameter), format convert to a DXGI_FORMAT if required, and then create a 2D texture\&. Note this does not support 1D textures, volume textures, cubemaps, or texture arrays\&. DDSTextureLoader is recommended for fully 'precooked' textures for maximum performance and image quality, but this loader can be useful for creating simple 2D texture from standard image files at runtime\&.

.SS "Release Notes"
.IP "\(bu" 2
Starting with the June 2020 release, this library makes use of typed enum bitmask flags per the recommendation of the \fIC++ Standard\fP section \fI17\&.5\&.2\&.1\&.3 Bitmask types\fP\&. This is consistent with Direct3D 12's use of the \fCDEFINE_ENUM_FLAG_OPERATORS\fP macro\&. This may have \fIbreaking change\fP impacts to client code:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
You cannot pass the \fC0\fP literal as your flags value\&. Instead you must make use of the appropriate default enum value: \fCCP_FLAGS_NONE\fP, \fCDDS_FLAGS_NONE\fP, \fCWIC_FLAGS_NONE\fP, \fCTEX_FR_ROTATE0\fP, \fCTEX_FILTER_DEFAULT\fP, \fCTEX_FILTER_DEFAULT\fP, \fCTEX_FILTER_DEFAULT\fP, \fCCNMAP_DEFAULT\fP, or \fCCNMAP_DEFAULT\fP\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use the enum type instead of \fCDWORD\fP if building up flags values locally with bitmask operations\&. For example, \fCDDS_FLAGS flags = DDS_FLAGS_NONE; if (\&.\&.\&.) flags |= DDS_FLAGS_EXPAND_LUMINANCE;\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
In cases where some of the flags overlap, you can use the \fC|\fP to combine the relevant types: \fCTEX_FILTER_FLAGS\fP filter modes combine with \fCWIC_FLAGS\fP, \fCTEX_FILTER_FLAGS\fP sRGB flags combine with \fCTEX_PMALPHA_FLAGS\fP or \fCTEX_COMPRESS_FLAGS\fP\&. No other bitwise operators are defined\&. For example, \fCWIC_FLAGS wicFlags = WIC_FLAGS_NONE | TEX_FILTER_CUBIC;\fP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Due to the underlying Windows BMP WIC codec, alpha channels are not supported for 16bpp or 32bpp BMP pixel format files\&. The Windows 8\&.x and Windows 10 version of the Windows BMP WIC codec does support 32bpp pixel formats with alpha when using the \fCBITMAPV5HEADER\fP file header\&. Note the updated WIC is available on Windows 7 SP1 with \fCKB 2670838\fP installed\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
While DXGI 1\&.0 and DXGI 1\&.1 include 5:6:5 (\fCDXGI_FORMAT_B5G6R5_UNORM\fP) and 5:5:5:1 (\fCDXGI_FORMAT_B5G5R5A1_UNORM\fP) pixel format enumerations, the DirectX 10\&.x and 11\&.0 Runtimes do not support these formats for use with Direct3D\&. The DirectX 11\&.1 runtime, DXGI 1\&.2, and the WDDM 1\&.2 driver model fully support 16bpp formats (5:6:5, 5:5:5:1, and 4:4:4:4)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
WICTextureLoader cannot load \fC\&.TGA\fP or \fC\&.HDR\fP files unless the system has a 3rd party WIC codec installed\&. You must use the DirectXTex library for TGA/HDR file format support without relying on an add-on WIC codec\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Loading of 96bpp floating-point TIFF files results in a corrupted image prior to Windows 8\&. This fix is available on Windows 7 SP1 with KB 2670838 installed\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The UWP projects and the Win10 classic desktop project include configurations for the ARM64 platform\&. Building these requires installing the ARM64 toolset\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
When using clang/LLVM for the ARM64 platform, the Windows 11 SDK (\fC22000\fP) is required\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The \fCCompileShaders\&.cmd\fP script must have Windows-style (CRLF) line-endings\&. If it is changed to Linux-style (LF) line-endings, it can fail to build all the required shaders\&.
